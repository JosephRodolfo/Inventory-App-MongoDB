# Inventory-App-MongoDB

This was my first attempt at using MongoDB for one of my own projects, just a little inventory app, though I never decided what the inventory would be. I'm not sure I'll revisit this because I've done the same thing on later projects, but in retrospect I think I struggled because I didn't fully understand what Handlebars and other templating languages were meant for and the difference between what should be handled server side vs. client side was much less clear to me than it is now. I took these lessons and applied them to future projects.
